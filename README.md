# Credit-Default
Credit default prediction model
Business Problem to be Solved
In the banking industry, customer payment default has an impact on banks' profitability. This analysis
aims at helping a major bank better understand its customers and informing future strategies of offering
targeted clients credit products. The model predicts customer default likelihood and
identifies key drivers that impact the default behavior. The prediction helps the bank to maximize profit
by making decisions to issue credit products and credit limits to those who will likely repay. We are 
tasked to learn from a set of 24,000 current clients and build a classification model which
we will then assign to our 1,000 new applicants. From a given set of variables on the customer level, we
are also provided the option to "engineer" new features to improve our accuracy when approving
applicants for new credit.
